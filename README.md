# BotGoneWild
A Reddit bot that is called by another user to inspect whether or not another account has posted or commented in /r/gonewild.
# Syntax
Has /u/username gone wild?

# Issues
Occasionally the comment will not get replied to. If this is the case, deleting the comment and reposting it should work. This is likely due to a limit of the number of comments it can pull at one time and your comment happened to be past the maximum amount of comments at that time.

If you would like to inspect this on another user, but not in a public manner, simply head over to https://reddit.com/r/test and post in the comments of any of those submissions.

Feedback/suggestions for this bot or any others is gladly welcomed.
