Here is the FAQ in all its glory:

# BotGoneWild
A Reddit bot that is called by another user to inspect whether or not another account has posted or commented in /r/gonewild.
# Syntax
BotGoneWild! Has /u/username gone wild?

This will also send a notification to /u/username letting them know of the query.

# Blacklisting/whitelisting yourself
You can request that your account is not queried by sending a message to /u/BotGoneWild with the subject line of 'Blacklist'. To be re-added to the queries, simply send a message with 'Whitelist' in the subject line.

# Issues
Occasionally the comment will not get replied to. If this is the case, deleting the comment and reposting it should work. This is likely due to a limit of the number of comments it can pull at one time and your comment happened to be past the maximum amount of comments at that time.

# Feedback
