# BotGoneWild
A Reddit bot that is called by another user to inspect whether or not another account has posted or commented in /r/gonewild.
# Syntax
Has /u/username gone wild?

# Issues
Occasionally the comment will not get replied to. If this is the case, deleting the comment and reposting it should work. This is likely due to a limit of the number of comments it can pull at one time and your comment happened to be past the maximum amount of comments at that time.

# Suggestions
If you would like to inspect this on another user, but not in a public manner, simply head over to https://reddit.com/r/test and post in the comments of any of those submissions.

# Feedback
[Feedback/suggestions](https://reddit.com/r/botgonewild) for this bot or suggestions for any others is gladly welcomed. You can also file a bug on the github page, or [send me a pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=camerongagnon).
